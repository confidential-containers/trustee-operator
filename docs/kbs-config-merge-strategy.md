# Generated Attributes vs User-configurable attributes in KbsConfig

This document explains what happens to generated attributes when they are modified in KbsConfig.

## Overview

The TrusteeConfig controller generates certain fields in KbsConfig, but some fields are left empty for user customization. The merge logic handles these differently.

## Field Categories

### 1. **Fields Generated by TrusteeConfig**
These fields are **always managed** by TrusteeConfig and will be overwritten:

- `KbsConfigMapName` - Main KBS configuration
- `KbsRvpsRefValuesConfigMapName` - RVPS reference values
- `KbsAuthSecretName` - Authentication secret
- `KbsServiceType` - Service type
- `KbsDeploymentType` - Deployment type (always set to AllInOneDeployment)
- `KbsResourcePolicyConfigMapName` - Resource policy

**Behavior**: If you modify these fields manually, they will be **overwritten** by TrusteeConfig during reconciliation.

### 2. **Fields NOT Generated by TrusteeConfig (User-Configurable)**
These fields are **preserved** from manual edits:

- `KbsDeploymentSpec.Replicas` - Replica count (TrusteeConfig default is 1)
- `KbsEnvVars` - Environment variables (merged with generated ones)
- `KbsHttpsKeySecretName/CertSecretName` - Custom HTTPS certificates
- `KbsSecretResources` - Additional secret resources
- `KbsLocalCertCacheSpec` - Local certificate cache
- `TdxConfigSpec` - TDX configuration
- `IbmSEConfigSpec` - IBM SE configuration
- `KbsAttestationPolicyConfigMapName` - Custom attestation policy

**Behavior**: These fields are **preserved** from your manual edits.
