# Introduction

The `trustee-operator` manages the lifecycle of [trustee](https://github.com/confidential-containers/trustee)
along with its configuration when deployed in a Kubernetes cluster

## Description

The operator manages a Kubernetes custom resource named: `KbsConfig`. Following are the key fields of the
`KbsConfig` custom resource definition

```golang
// KbsConfigSpec defines the desired state of KbsConfig

}
```

>Note: the default deployment type is ```MicroservicesDeployment```. 
The examples below apply to this mode.

An example configmap for the KBS configuration looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kbs-config-grpc
  namespace: trustee-operator-system
data:
  kbs-config.toml: |
    [http_server]
    sockets = ["0.0.0.0:8080"]
    insecure_http = true
    [admin]
    insecure_api = true
    auth_public_key = "/etc/auth-secret/kbs.pem"

    [attestation_token]
    insecure_key = true

    [attestation_service]
    type = "coco_as_grpc"
    as_addr = "http://127.0.0.1:50004"

    [[plugins]]
    name = "resource"
    type = "LocalFs"
    dir_path = "/opt/confidential-containers/kbs/repository"

    [policy_engine]
    policy_path = "/opt/confidential-containers/opa/policy.rego"

```

If HTTPS support is not needed, please set `insecure_http=true` and no need to specify the attributes `private_key` and `certificate`.

An example configmap for AS config looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: as-config-grpc
  namespace: trustee-operator-system
data:
  as-config.json: |
    {
        "work_dir": "/opt/confidential-containers/attestation-service",
        "policy_engine": "opa",
        "rvps_config": {
          "type": "GrpcRemote",
          "address": "http://127.0.0.1:50003"
        },
        "attestation_token_broker": {
          "type": "Ear",
          "policy_dir": "/opt/confidential-containers/attestation-service/policies"
        },
        "attestation_token_config": {
          "duration_min": 5
        }
    }
```

Currently these configmaps needs to be created during deployment.
In subsequent releases we'll look into having these configmaps created by the operator based on user inputs.

A sample `KbsConfig` custom resource

```yaml
apiVersion: confidentialcontainers.org/v1alpha1
kind: KbsConfig
metadata:  
  name: kbsconfig-sample
  namespace: trustee-operator-system
spec:
  # KBS configuration
  kbsConfigMapName: kbs-config
  # AS configuration
  kbsAsConfigMapName: as-config  
  # RVPS configuration
  kbsRvpsConfigMapName: rvps-config-grpc
  # reference values config map
  kbsRvpsReferenceValuesMapName: rvps-reference-values
  # authentication secret
  kbsAuthSecretName: kbs-auth-public-key
  # service type
  kbsServiceType: ClusterIP
  # deployment type
  kbsDeploymentType: MicroservicesDeployment
  # HTTPS support
  kbsHttpsKeySecretName: kbs-https-key
  kbsHttpsCertSecretName: kbs-https-certificate
  # K8s Secrets to be made available to KBS clients
  kbsSecretResources: ["kbsres1"]
  # Attestation policy
  kbsAttestationPolicyConfigMapName: attestation-policy
  # Resource policy
  kbsResourcePolicyConfigMapName: resource-policy
  # TDX settings
  tdxConfigSpec:
    kbsTdxConfigMapName: tdx-config-sample
  # IBMSE settings
  ibmSEConfigSpec:
    certStorePvc: ibmse-pvc
  # Mount VCEK certificate for disconnected environment
  kbsLocalCertCacheSpec:
    secretName: vcek-secret
    mountPath: "/etc/kbs/snp/ek"
```

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.

>Note: Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

Ensure you have `golang`, `kubectl`, `make` available in the `$PATH`.

#### Deploying prebuilt operator image

If you want to deploy latest prebuilt image, then run the following command:

```sh
make deploy IMG=quay.io/confidential-containers/trustee-operator:latest
```

Verify if the controller is running by executing the following command:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n trustee-operator-system --watch
```

You should see a similar output as below:

```sh
NAME                                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
trustee-operator-controller-manager-6797b78467-zndkv   1/1     Running   0          111s
```

#### Deployment of CRDs, ConfigMaps and Secrets

This is an example deployment. Review the config files and change it as per your requirements.

```sh
cd config/samples/all-in-one
# or config/samples/microservices for the microservices mode

# create authentication keys
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 > privateKey
openssl pkey -in privateKey -pubout -out kbs.pem

# create all the needed resources
kubectl apply -k .
```

Verify if the trustee deployment is running by executing the following command:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n trustee-operator-system --selector=app=kbs
```

You should see a similar output as below:

```sh
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
trustee-deployment-78bd97f6d4-nxsbb   3/3     Running   0          4m3s
```

The default installation uses empty reference values. You must add real values by updating
the `rvps-reference-values` ConfigMap like shown in the example below:

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: rvps-reference-values
  namespace: trustee-operator-system
data:
  reference-values.json: |
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: rvps-reference-values
      namespace: trustee-operator-system
    data:
      reference-values.json: |
        [
          {
            "name": "svn",
            "expired": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "hash-value": [
              {
                "alg": "sha256",
                "value": "1"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
```

The default installation creates a sample K8s secret named `kbsres1` to be made available to clients.
Take a look at [patch-kbs-resources.yaml](config/samples/microservices/patch-kbs-resources.yaml) and update it
with the K8s secrets that you want to deliver to clients via Trustee.

#### IBM Secure Execution

For IBM SE specific configuration, please refer to [ibmse.md](docs/ibmse.md).
  
#### ITA configuration

For Intel's ITA specific configuration, please refer to [ita.md](docs/ita.md).

### Mount certificates for disconnected environment

Please refer to [disconnected.md](docs/disconnected.md).

### Uninstallation

Ensure you are in the root folder of the project before running the uninstall commands.

#### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

#### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

Contributions are most welcome. Please take a look at the [guide](https://github.com/confidential-containers/confidential-containers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out

- Install the CRDs into the cluster.

  ```sh
  make install
  ```

- Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

  ```sh
  make run
  ```

>Note: You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

#### Building your own operator image

If using a remote Kubernetes cluster for testing, then you'll need to
build the controller image and deploy it.

- Export env variables.

  Set `REGISTRY` environment variable to point to your container registry.
  For example:

  ```sh
  export REGISTRY=quay.io/user
  ```

- Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`.

  ```sh
  make docker-build docker-push IMG=${REGISTRY}/trustee-operator:latest
  ```

  Change the tag from `latest` to any other based on your requirements.
  Also ensure that the image is public.

- Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`.

  ```sh
  make deploy IMG=${REGISTRY}/trustee-operator:latest
  ```

### Integration tests

An attestation with the sample-attester is performed in an ephemeral kind cluster:

Prerequisites:

- [kuttl](https://kuttl.dev/docs/cli.html#setup-the-kuttl-kubectl-plugin) plugin installed
- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation) installed

Optional: set the env variables KBS_IMAGE_NAME and CLIENT_IMAGE_NAME to override the default trustee/client images

  ```sh
  KBS_IMAGE_NAME=<trustee-image> CLIENT_IMAGE_NAME=<client-image> make test-e2e
  ```

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

>Note: Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
