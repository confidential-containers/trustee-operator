# trustee-operator

The `trustee-operator` manages the lifecycle of [trustee](https://github.com/confidential-containers/trustee) along with it's configuration when deployed
in a Kubernetes cluster

## Description

The operator manages a Kubernetes custom resource named: `KbsConfig`. Following are the key fields of the
`KbsConfig` custom resource definition

```golang
// KbsConfigSpec defines the desired state of KbsConfig
type KbsConfigSpec struct {
  // KbsConfigMapName is the name of the configmap that contains the KBS configuration
  KbsConfigMapName string `json:"kbsConfigMapName,omitempty"`

  // KbsAsConfigMapName is the name of the configmap that contains the KBS AS configuration
  // Required only when MicroservicesDeployment is set

  KbsAsConfigMapName string `json:"kbsAsConfigMapName,omitempty"`

  // KbsRvpsConfigMapName is the name of the configmap that contains the KBS RVPS configuration
  // Required only when MicroservicesDeployment is set
  // +optional
  KbsRvpsConfigMapName string `json:"kbsRvpsConfigMapName,omitempty"`

  // kbsRvpsRefValuesConfigMapName is the name of the configmap that contains the RVPS reference values
  KbsRvpsRefValuesConfigMapName string `json:"kbsRvpsRefValuesConfigMapName,omitempty"`

  // KbsAuthSecretName is the name of the secret that contains the KBS auth secret

  // Default value is ClusterIP
  // +optional
  KbsServiceType corev1.ServiceType `json:"kbsServiceType,omitempty"`

  // KbsDeploymentType is the type of KBS deployment
  // It can assume one of the following values:
  //    AllInOneDeployment: all the KBS components will be deployed in the same container
  //    MicroservicesDeployment: all the KBS components will be deployed in separate containers
  // +kubebuilder:validation:Enum=AllInOneDeployment;MicroservicesDeployment
  // Default value is AllInOneDeployment
  // +optional
  KbsDeploymentType DeploymentType `json:"kbsDeploymentType,omitempty"`

  // KbsHttpsKeySecretName is the name of the secret that contains the KBS https private key
  KbsHttpsKeySecretName string `json:"kbsHttpsKeySecretName,omitempty"`

  // KbsHttpsCertSecretName is the name of the secret that contains the KBS https certificate
  KbsHttpsCertSecretName string `json:"kbsHttpsCertSecretName,omitempty"`

  // KbsSecretResources is an array of secret names that contain the keys required by clients
  // +optional
  KbsSecretResources []string `json:"kbsSecretResources,omitempty"`

  // KbsAttestationPolicyConfigMapName is the name of the configmap that contains the Attestation Policy
  // +optional
  KbsAttestationPolicyConfigMapName string `json:"kbsAttestationPolicyConfigMapName,omitempty"`

  // KbsResourcePolicyConfigMapName is the name of the configmap that contains the Resource Policy
  // +optional
  KbsResourcePolicyConfigMapName string `json:"kbsResourcePolicyConfigMapName,omitempty"`

  // TdxConfigSpec is the struct that hosts the TDX specific configuration
  // +optional
  TdxConfigSpec TdxConfigSpec `json:"tdxConfigSpec,omitempty"`

  // IbmSEConfigSpec is the struct that hosts the IBMSE specific configuration
  // +optional
  IbmSEConfigSpec IbmSEConfigSpec `json:"ibmSEConfigSpec,omitempty"`
}

// IbmSEConfigSpec defines the desired state for IBMSE configuration
type IbmSEConfigSpec struct {
  // certStorePvc is the name of the PeristentVolumeClaim where certificates/keys are mounted
  // +optional
  CertStorePvc string `json:"certStorePvc,omitempty"`
}

// TdxConfigSpec defines the desired state for TDX configuration
type TdxConfigSpec struct {
  // kbsTdxConfigMapName is the name of the configmap containing sgx_default_qcnl.conf file
  // +optional
  KbsTdxConfigMapName string `json:"kbsTdxConfigMapName,omitempty"`
}```

Note: the default deployment type is ```MicroservicesDeployment```.
The examples below apply to this mode.

An example configmap for the KBS configuration looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kbs-config-grpc
  namespace: trustee-operator-system
data:
  kbs-config.json: |
    {
        "insecure_http" : false,
        "sockets": ["0.0.0.0:8080"],
        "auth_public_key": "/etc/auth-secret/kbs.pem",
        "private_key": "/etc/https-key/key.pem",
        "certificate": "/etc/https-cert/cert.pem",
        "attestation_token_config": {
          "attestation_token_type": "CoCo"
        },
        "grpc_config" : {
          "as_addr": "http://127.0.0.1:50004"
        }
    }
```

If HTTPS support is not needed, please set `insecure_http=true` and no need to specify the attributes `private_key` and `certificate`.

An example configmap for AS config looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: as-config-grpc
  namespace: trustee-operator-system
data:
  as-config.json: |
    {
        "work_dir": "/opt/confidential-containers/attestation-service",
        "policy_engine": "opa",
        "rvps_config": {
           "remote_addr":"http://127.0.0.1:50003"
        },
        "attestation_token_broker": "Simple",
        "attestation_token_config": {
          "duration_min": 5
        }
    }
```

Currently these configmaps needs to be created during deployment.
In subsequent releases we'll look into having these configmaps created by the operator based on user inputs.

A sample `KbsConfig` custom resource

```yaml
apiVersion: confidentialcontainers.org/v1alpha1
kind: KbsConfig
metadata:  
  name: kbsconfig-sample
  namespace: trustee-operator-system
spec:
  # KBS configuration
  kbsConfigMapName: kbs-config
  # AS configuration
  kbsAsConfigMapName: as-config  
  # RVPS configuration
  kbsRvpsConfigMapName: rvps-config-grpc
  # reference values config map
  kbsRvpsReferenceValuesMapName: rvps-reference-values
  # authentication secret
  kbsAuthSecretName: kbs-auth-public-key
  # service type
  kbsServiceType: ClusterIP
  # deployment type
  kbsDeploymentType: MicroservicesDeployment
  # HTTPS support
  kbsHttpsKeySecretName: kbs-https-key
  kbsHttpsCertSecretName: kbs-https-certificate
  # K8s Secrets to be made available to KBS clients
  kbsSecretResources: ["kbsres1"]
  # Attestation policy
  kbsAttestationPolicyConfigMapName: attestation-policy
  # Resource policy
  kbsResourcePolicyConfigMapName: resource-policy
  # TDX settings
  tdxConfigSpec:
    kbsTdxConfigMapName: tdx-config-sample
  # IBMSE settings
  ibmSEConfigSpec:
    certStorePvc: ibmse-pvc
```

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

- Export env variables.

  Set `REGISTRY` environment variable to point to your container registry.
  For example:

  ```sh
  export REGISTRY=quay.io/user
  ```

- Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`.

  ```sh
  make docker-build docker-push IMG=${REGISTRY}/kbs-operator:latest
  ```

  Change the tag from `latest` to any other based on your requirements.
  Also ensure that the image is public.

- Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`.

  ```sh
  make deploy IMG=${REGISTRY}/kbs-operator:latest
  ```

- Deployment of CRDs, ConfigMaps and Secrets

  This is an example. Change it to real values as per your requirements.

  It is recommended to uncomment the secret generation for the trustee authorization in the  [kustomization.yaml](config/samples/microservices/kustomization.yaml), for both public and private key (`kbs-auth-public-key` and `kbs-client` secrets)

  For enabling logs with DEBUG severity, uncomment the `patch-env-vars.yaml` line in the  [kustomization.yaml](config/samples/microservices/kustomization.yaml).

  ```sh
  cd config/samples/microservices
  # or config/samples/all-in-one for the integrated mode

  # create authentication keys
  openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 > privateKey
  openssl pkey -in privateKey -pubout -out kbs.pem
  
  # create all the needed resources
  kubectl apply -k .
  ```

  Among various things, the command above is also responsible for injecting reference values into the RVPS component. The default json file is an empty sequence, but you may want to inject real values by applying a ConfigMap like the one below:

  ``` yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: rvps-reference-values
    namespace: trustee-operator-system
  data:
    reference-values.json: |
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: ConfigMap
      metadata:
        name: rvps-reference-values
        namespace: trustee-operator-system
      data:
        reference-values.json: |
          [
            {
              "name": "sample.svn",
              "expired": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
              "hash-value": [
                {
                  "alg": "sha256",
                  "value": "1"
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
  ```

  It is also possible to create the K8s secrets (a commented out example is provided in the [kustomization.yaml](config/samples/microservices/kustomization.yaml)). To enable the secrets you'd need to uncomment the relevant secret generator entry and patch.

### IBM Secure Execution

For IBM SE specific configuration, please refer to [ibmse.md](docs/ibmse.md).
  
### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

Contributions are most welcome. Please take a look at the [guide](https://github.com/confidential-containers/confidential-containers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out

- Install the CRDs into the cluster.

  ```sh
  make install
  ```

- Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

  ```sh
  make run
  ```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Integration tests

An attestation with the sample-attester is performed in an ephemeral kind cluster
Pre-requirements:
- [kuttl](https://kuttl.dev/docs/cli.html#setup-the-kuttl-kubectl-plugin) plugin installed
- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation) installed

Optional: set the env variables KBS_IMAGE_NAME and CLIENT_IMAGE_NAME to override the default trustee/client images

  ```sh
  KBS_IMAGE_NAME=<trustee-image> CLIENT_IMAGE_NAME=<client-image> make test-e2e
  ```

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
